# GI Webtool for Geotechnical Engineers & Engineering Geologists
(Early-stage side project – under development.)

A web-based Ground Investigation (GI) tool for visualising and interacting with geotechnical site data.

## Current Issues
- Map renders twice (should render once).
- `Folium_Map.py` bugs.
- Currently built with Streamlit — considering migration to FastAPI, or cleaning up   Streamlit.

## Next Steps
- Refactor map rendering logic.
- Clean up project structure.
- Improve UI.
- Evaluate framework upgrade.
